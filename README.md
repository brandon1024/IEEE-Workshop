# IEEE Workshop - Pointers on C
Welcome :wave: Chances are you stumbled here through the workshop I gave for IEEE UNB. The purpose of this workshop is to give engineering students some helpful tips on writing better C. The C programming language is arguably the most difficult language to master, but I hope that these materials will help you take another step forward.

In this workshop, I'm going to cover four main concepts:
- Using Structures Effectively
- Good Memory Management Tips
- Variadic Functions
- Functional Programming

In doing this, I hope to also demonstrate how to use the CLion IDE, CMake build tool, Git for version control, and demonstrate good C code style guidelines.

Each part in this workshop has a README which provides information and examples on the topics covered. The topics in this workshop are fairly introductory, but assume those attending the workshop have a fairly basic exposure to C.

## Where Can I Get More Info?
If you want to become a good C developer, you should read through the [coding guidelines](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/CodingGuidelines). This coding style is what I have adopted, and it has really helped me write clean C code.

If you plan to work on a C project, I highly recommend learning how to use the CMake build tool. The learning curve is steep, and it's very different than tools like `gradle` or `npm`, but it will save you headache down the road.

## Who Am I?
My name is Brandon Richardson, I am a software engineering student in my fourth year of university at the University of New Brunswick. Over the past two years, I have taken interest in the C programming language, and now a large majority of my programming today is in C.
